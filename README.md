swdv220 and swdv235 database project

In this project we were tasked with creating a database and user interface for a personal media library. The end user would use this application to track the media items that they lend to family and friends. 

The database and stored procedures were created using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio for swdv220.
The user interface was created using Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 with the ASP.Net Core MVC framework for swdv235.
